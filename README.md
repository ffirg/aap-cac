# aap-cac

This repo contains examples of how to seed AAP configuration using a config-as-code approach.
This is designed to be used with the infra.* validated collections (https://console.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub/namespaces/infra/) and the containerized AAP post installer but can also be used standalone.
Some changes are required due to significant platform re-engineering in 2.5 so working content according to AAP version has been split out for testing purposes.
