# aap-cac

This repo contains examples of how to seed AAP configuration using a config-as-code approach.
It was created for testing postinstall content seeding during containerized AAP installation time.
This repo has a number of branches for testing with different AAP platform versions.
This is designed to be used with the infra.* validated collections (https://console.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub/namespaces/infra/) and the containerized AAP post installer
