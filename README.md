# aap-cac

This repo contains examples of how to seed AAP configuration using a config-as-code approach.

It was created for testing postinstall content seeding during containerized AAP installation time.

This repo has a number of branches for testing with different AAP platform versions.

You will want to switch to or use the relevant git branch for the right AAP version (2.4, 2.5 etc)

This is designed to be used with the infra.* validated collections (https://console.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub/namespaces/infra/) and the containerized AAP post installer
